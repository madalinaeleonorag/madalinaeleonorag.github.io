        I have led and contributed to the development of complex internal web applications, with a strong focus on creating intuitive and functional user interfaces, and robust solutions for critical business challenges.

        I initiated and led the development of two major internal operations applications from scratch:
        <ul>
        <li>Banking Fraud Targeting Application: A web app for real-time fraud monitoring, offering user-centric dashboards, advanced search, fraud detection tools (robotic/human fraud), and law enforcement access to support rapid investigations.</li>
        <li>Employee Access Management Application: A self-service tool enabling employees to request and manage access for internal systems, streamlining approval processes.</li>
        </li>
        </ul>
        Focused primarily on the fraud platform, I built a modular, scalable 11-flow application with distinct access levels, leveraging efficient component reusability to manage complexity. Some of the most complex functionalities for my application are:
        <ul>
        <li>Complex Data Visualization & Decision Support: Developed dynamic tables with clear transaction layouts, where each row links to detailed pages. This empowers agents to make informed decisions (e.g., fraud declarations) and initiate downstream banking processes.</li>
        <li>Investigation Pages Development: Designed and implemented a complex AG Grid-based page (evolved from Kendo) supporting user-dependent bulk changes on 50,000+ transactions, featuring dynamic validations, advanced navigation, and context-based feature access.</li>
        <li>Real-time Monitoring Implementation: Developed a complex interface connected to the banking system in real-time, enabling on-call agents to monitor fraud and transactions proactively and intervene before automated triggers.</li>
        <li>Streamlined Transaction Search & Investigation: Implemented role-based search functionalities tailored for on-call agents, culminating in a powerful search interface. This enables agents to quickly locate specific fraudulent transactions, optimizing workflows and significantly improving the efficiency of fraud claim resolution. The solution empowers agents to access critical information and make informed decisions during live customer interactions.</li>
        </li>
        </ul>
        Served as the lead frontend developer for over a year, while also taking on junior-level Java backend tasks when needed. Demonstrated a solid understanding of the full system architecture and a strong team-first mindset by stepping in to support cross-functional efforts.
        <br><br>
        Achieved strong production impact over time by eliminating incidents through a deepening understanding of banking processes. Replaced a legacy interface with a modern, user-friendly UI that improved agent experience. Played a key role in frontend deployments to test and production environments, ensuring application stability and availability.
        <br><br>
        Stepped in as Team Lead for another team for one month during the leader’s absence. Actively managed team activities, increased feature delivery, and optimized communication with management.
        <br><br>
        Maintained up-to-date tasks, sprints, and backlog to ensure smooth project flow. Led feature definition meetings, owned requirements, and proposed frontend solutions that enhanced development and team efficiency. Presented demos to clients, contributing to strategic decision-making. Facilitated communication and problem-solving across teams to ensure alignment, timely delivery, and continuous quality improvement.
        <br><br>
        Took full ownership of the application’s design and user experience, successfully adapting innovative ideas within technical constraints without a dedicated designer. Held complete decision-making authority over design and creative aspects in the past year.
        <br><br>
        Mentored new colleagues and fostered cross-team collaboration, promoting knowledge transfer and skill development focused on frontend best practices. Actively supported team members in learning unit testing with Jasmine.
